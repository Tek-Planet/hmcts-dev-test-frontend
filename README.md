## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash

- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

## Authentication Flow

The application uses a context-based authentication system:

1. Users register/login through secure forms
2. JWT tokens are stored in localStorage
3. Protected routes check authentication status
4. Token refresh is handled automatically
5. Logout clears all authentication data

## Task Management

Tasks include the following properties:
- Title and description
- Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- Due dates
- Status tracking
- User assignment

## Design System

The application uses a semantic token-based design system:
- Consistent color palette defined in `index.css`
- Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Component variants using class-variance-authority
- Dark/light mode support

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: User flow testing
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance verification
- **API Tests**: Service layer testing

Tests are located alongside components in `__tests__` directories.

## Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

## Security Considerations
